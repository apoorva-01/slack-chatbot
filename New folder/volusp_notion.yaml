They tested these options on the  "SKIO-workspace-latest"  theme in the dev store and reviewed how both the flyout and Cart appear when adding items for subscription. Here‚Äôs theproduct link for reference:   https://voluspa-us-dev.myshopify.com/products/ambre-lumiere-luxe-candle\nThey want to confirm the following:\n- Can subscription frequency be editable directly in the flyout and/or Cart, allowing customers to modify without removing and re-adding the item. The flyout currently shows the selected frequency, but it‚Äôs not displayed in the Cart.\n- Display the discount as prominently as possible from the product detail page (PDP) through to the Flyout and Cart, making savings highly visible.\n- When an item is added as a one-time purchase but is eligible for a subscription, they want to provide an option for the user to switch from one-time to subscription within the flyout or Cart. The discount visibility might encourage users to subscribe.\nVideo for context:  https://vimeo.com/1007728436/ad37de7ffd?share=copy\nI reached out to SKIO support, and they confirmed that implementing these features is feasible. According to Nick from SKIO, third-party apps like Rebuy or Aftersell offer this functionality out-of-the-box, but it can also be achieved through custom coding within the flyout cart.\nSince we are not using these apps and are integrating our upsell feature into the flyout cart using  LimeSpot , custom code will likely be required to meet the client‚Äôs requests. SKIO provided the following API documentation to guide our implementation:  SKIO API Docs .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa -

Gift Wrapping Project (Added request)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:21:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-06-05\nDeployment Date: 2024-08-20\nTotal Project Hours: 13\nProjected Dev Hours: 10\nProjected QI Hours: 2\nDetails: The objective o this project is to complete the following new requests from client related to ‚Äú  Voluspa - Gift Wrapping Project ‚Äù. \nNote to Devs:  Please make sure that we have all the existing features we have implemented in ‚Äú  Voluspa - Gift Wrapping Project ‚Äù but use a separate branch for this project since this will be another iteration. \nNote to QI:  This project has the additional request/tasks the client have asked us to work on. During your testing, make sure that all integrated features found in ‚Äú  Voluspa - Gift Wrapping Project ‚Äù are present plus these new updates below. \n- If the product quantity is updated by the user from (e.i 4) and updated it to 1 the error message should no longer appear and the GW qty should automatically be set to 1. Video:  https://vimeo.com/886476544/1f79e01b43?share=copy\n- Make sure that the GW qty pop up fires/ shows instantly when the product qty is updated to more than 1. Currently it does not pop instantly instead client needs to manually click the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù link to update the GW qty. \nIMPORTANT NOTE :  This feature  will not work for BYO products  since when product qty is updated the page reloads and it uses that as an opportunity to update child items so the auto pop for GW qty wont work for bundles. \nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/886479191/37a74564e3?share=copy\nClient would like to have an option in the customizer that would them to choose (switch) whether they want Gift Notes tied with Gift wrapping or keep it separate and available all the time. \nTASK:  Add a setting in the customizer that would allow them to switch between:\n1.  Gift Notes tied up with Gift wrapping option \n2.  Gift notes separated from GW and be available all the time. (Meaning, it should be available regardless if the user avails of a gift wrapping option or have added a non-eligible GW product) \nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/893339961/7d07adb036?share=copy\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Gift Wrapping Project\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:21:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-06-05\nDeployment Date: 2024-08-20\nTotal Project Hours: 5\nProjected Dev Hours: 3\nProjected QI Hours: 1\nDetails: The objective of this project is to implement the task below on Voluspa store.\nBackground: \nLast week Voluspa went through a gift wrapping project analysis to determine what we wanted to offer their customers for this Holiday and determined impact to costs and labor - both for online and in-store. \nPROJECT: To implement a GIFT WRAPPING option on their cart page. This would allow the user to choose if they want their ordered item to be gift wrapped. \nFIGMA FILE:  https://www.figma.com/proto/Btam7gVqfbAtefH8dORW8T/Voluspa?type=design&node-id=1535-2&t=vLLt8SMEZwrCNEkT-0&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1\nCLIENT RECORDING:  https://vimeo.com/876785072/9f51908027?share=copy\nScope of Work:\nVIDEO:  https://vimeo.com/877436729/3fa50aba05?share=copy\nVIDEO:  https://vimeo.com/877438795/630676a87d?share=copy\nVIDEO:  https://vimeo.com/877439205/db7307d600?share=copy\nUPDATE: It is possible to hide the gift wrap products in cart but not in checkout. However, we would have to let the client know first about this. I have advised first the team to show them first just so we can see how its going to show if its not hidden and let the cilent decide)\nVIDEO:  https://vimeo.com/877440007/ac8b2e6594?share=copy\nVIDEO:  https://vimeo.com/877441463/bbe5d486f9?share=copy\nDESKTOP:\nMOBILE: ‚Äúi‚Äù would still be there but would only be clickable and once clicked the symbol changes from grey to black\nVIDEO:  https://vimeo.com/877442570/23e959723b?share=copy\nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/877443616/02a4088455?share=copy\nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/877444965/8950ead836?share=copy\n- If the user is does not qualify it should show :example  ‚ÄúYou are $35 away from qualifying for Free Shipping & a COmplimentary Sample‚Äù\n- If the user qualifies it should show  the text in the screenshot\n- Client would like us to add a line item property to item as boolean if the item has a gift wrap option or not.  Make sure this is implemented \n- For bundles GW will be based only on parent product\nClient have identified that they need to have 50 different variations of GW types and would have to be presented by different SKUs. \n Client would need to add those variations to the metaobjects and assigned the designated SKUs for each of GW product/type. \nTASKS:\n- Make sure that we hide the SKU name in the front end to not confuse customers. The only text that should show in the front end are either ‚ÄúAdd Gift Wrap‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd Duster Bag‚Äù (This might c', 'hange depending on client‚Äôs perferred naming to show in the front end)\nHere‚Äôs a video:  https://vimeo.com/880533574/deffcbb006?share=copy\n- The mapping of the orders in the Shopify backend should also be correct like the screenshot below: They should have a separate custom line property for the GW product.\n- We would need to hide the added products for GW in the cart\nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/880534865/689e628ff3?share=copy\n- The gift note in Cart option needs to be ONLY AVAILABLE if the customer opts into giftwrapping. If t he user/customer does not select on any giftwrapping option. the gift note should not be available.\nüìé\xa0Project Docs \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Revisit Pricing Logic for 3 Mini Tin Trio Set (BYO)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:21:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-05-31\nDeployment Date: 2024-10-18\nTotal Project Hours: 39\nProjected Dev Hours: 30\nProjected QI Hours: 6\nDetails: The objective of the project is to complete the task below.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa- Markets Order Confirmation\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:21:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-06-03\nDeployment Date: 2024-06-06\nTotal Project Hours: 12\nProjected Dev Hours: 9\nProjected QI Hours: 2\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the task below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Markets (Regionalizing Metaobjects and Sample products)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:21:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-06-03\nDeployment Date: 2024-06-07\nTotal Project Hours: 31\nProjected Dev Hours: 23\nProjected QI Hours: 5\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the tasks below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Markets Investigation/Testing\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:21:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-05-31\nDeployment Date: 2024-05-31\nTotal Project Hours: 6\nProjected Dev Hours: 4\nProjected QI Hours: 1\nDetails: The objective of the project is to investigate and test the live site since Markets has been enabled by client.

They also had a callout from Fedex regarding their ‚ÄúRoom & Body Sprays‚Äù and ‚ÄúElectronic Diffuser Devices‚Äù which are considered ‚ÄúHazardous Materials‚Äù.  They are experiencing shipping regulations that will require for these products specifically to ALWAYS ship GROUND. \nThe very goal is for us to implement the following requirements below set by the client for their 3 different product types that are considered ‚ÄúHazardous Mater', "ials‚Äù (Matches, Room & Body Sprays, Electronic Diffuser Devices)\nAnytime one or more of these product types are added to order, FREE GROUND and STANDARD should be the only shipping methods visible at checkout. If the HazMat item is removed then full shipping option would become AVAILABLE.\nAlaska and Hawaii will not be able to order ANY of these 3 types of products since those location require air shipments.\n- Scenario 1:  Guest user/Not logged:  If a HazMat item is in the user‚Äôs cart when they proceed to checkout and enter their shipping info,  there should be  a banner/ call out  to be prompted just like the screenshot telling the user that the item will need to be removed. Here is an example from Sephora  - https://vimeo.com/913789050/ed04fc0adc?share=copy . \n- Scenario 2: Repeat buyer/Logged in users :  If a HazMat item is in the user‚Äôs cart and they have an address saved already and its either Alaska or Hawaii, once they proceed to checkout, they will be prompted  a banner/ call out . \n- We need to make sure the client has the ability to change the verbatim of the banner.\n- We need to add messaging to the PDP to advise customers before adding to cart and the client would be using the bar below (screenshot) to prompt them this message. Since this text (below) is global across all PDPs, we would need to provide an option for the client where they can manipulate this bar for specific PDPs. \n- Client should have an override option at the SKU level to deviate from the global messaging by using metafields. \nIn Cart page, we need to carry a small text disclaimer  (like what was implemented for the gift wrap project that called out something along the lines of ‚ÄúNot eligible for gift wrap‚Äù).  So in cart page, there‚Äôs this ‚ÄúShipping Restriction‚Äù and info icon available that when they hover on it or click on it they would see a pop up (text disclaimer)\nPlease check this video for more context:   https://vimeo.com/913804330/583d7eeca2?share=copy\nWith that capability:\n- the client should be able to pick/choose which items/ SKUs to show the disclaimer and what verbiage they would want to apply so that means there should be an available option via the customizer for them to edit the text disclaimer. For now use the disclaimer - ‚ÄúThis item is considered hazmat. Your order will ship by Ground‚Äù\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Wishlist removal\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-03-04\nDeployment Date: 2024-03-05\nTotal Project Hours: 3.5\nProjected Dev Hours: 1.5\nProjected QI Hours: 1\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the task below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Shopify Markets (Build Test Store)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-02-13\nDeployment Date: 2024-02-20\nTotal Project Hours: 22\nProjected Dev Hours: 16\nProjected QI Hours: 4\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the task below:\nThis project involves the development of a test store, aiming to explore and utilize Shopify's capabilities for managing multiple international markets.

As you can see on their Homepage (near bottom), there is a component tha", 't shows different Press where the brand has been mentioned. When the user hovers over the publication/press, you will see a quote dynamically appear that correlates to that pub. If the user clicks a certain publisher, the quote will remain fixed but if the user is simply hovering through the different pubs the quote will update.\nWe need to replicate the behavior on that section from the reference site (Merit) on Voluspa‚Äôs website. We need to make sure that as the users hovers over the pubs, the quote dynamically changes and updates and when they click on any of the pubs the quote will remain fixed. \nCheck this video:  https://vimeo.com/909968695/ced0c26337?share=copy\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Adding Collection Banner (Global Level)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-02-07\nDeployment Date: N/A\nTotal Project Hours: 9\nProjected Dev Hours: 6\nProjected QI Hours: 2\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the task below:\nCurrently with Voluspa‚Äôs new Collection page template, they have the ability to add banners at the collection level but not that global level anymore.

Below are the original complaint, Allyant‚Äôs feedback and recommendation from their legal team for the ADA complaint they have received back in Aug. \nComplaint:\nA. Location. Within three (3) months, Voluspa shall add a section or page on its website through which users can contact Voluspa regarding the website‚Äôs accessibility (‚ÄúAccessibility Statement‚Äù). Voluspa shall display a link to the Accessibility Statement towards the beginning of a screen reader user‚Äôs experience on the landing page for the website. Voluspa may choose any appropriate methodology that complies with this provision, including, but not limited to using index values placed on aria labels so that screen readers perceive the link to the Accessibility Statement as if it were located at the top section of the homepage or landing page. Voluspa may maintain a link to an Accessibility Statement may elsewhere on its website.\nAllyant‚Äôs recommendation for rebuttal:\n- On paragraph II, item A ‚Äì the text states ‚ÄúVoluspa shall display a link to the Accessibility Statement towards the beginning of a screen reader user‚Äôs experience on the landing page for the website.‚Äú There is no ', "requirement in WCAG for a site to have an Accessibility Statement, let alone specify where the link to the Accessibility Statement should be located. You may wish to try and strike this requirement or ensure that a link to the Accessibility Statement in the site footer, along with all the other legal-related links, is sufficient. If that isn‚Äôt possible, request clarification on whether this link to the Accessibility Statement in the site header must be visible to all users, or visible only to screen reader users and when it receives focus.\nLegal‚Äôs response::\nThe proposed link to the Accessibility Statement in the site header only needs to be visible to the screen reader, not visible to all users .\nTASK:  We need to add a navigation button on the header beside ‚ÄúFeatured‚Äù for Voluspa‚Äôs ‚ÄúAccessibility Statement (ADA) page but we need to make sure that this will be HIDDEN to all regular visitors/users but will be VISIBLE to all SCREEN READERS only.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - QR Code\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2023-12-28\nDeployment Date: 2024-01-08\nTotal Project Hours: 20\nProjected Dev Hours: 15\nProjected QI Hours: 3\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the task below:\nBackground:   Voluspa has a QR Generator app (QR Code Hub). They have used it probably for a couple years now just for different marketing purposes or in-store purposes where it'll take them to a landing page or whatnot. So Voluspa just use one of the free ones that were built for Shopify. There's a very small notice thing that the app does while the page is refreshing or redirecting. A lot of people even miss it, but when it gets caught people wonders about the brief text that shows up on that white pages. It says ‚Äúscan this QR code to visit us‚Äù and then it goes away and then it redirects to the page that you're supposed to go to. \nSome of their new products that they are launching in the spring. They want to put a QR code on the actual packaging of these finished goods. \nISSUE:   There is a pop up that shows very quickly and it goes away and redirects to the page that client wants the user to go to however, there seems to be a continual just a white page that briefly pops up before you get redirected, but it's usually a blank white page. \nTASK:  We need to remove the placeholder text that shows up by default when customers are scanning the QR Code. We need to make sure that after the customer scans the QR code, there is no white page and text that will show before redirecting them to the correct page.\nClient have sent the QR they have tested (Please see QR below). Tested it and was able to replicate the white page and the text popping. \nHere are the videos replicating the issue:\nAndroid:\nIOS (Iphone11 promax)\nI\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Liquid Maintenance\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: N/A\nDeployment Date: 2024-05-08\nTotal Project Hours: 0\nProjected Dev Hours: 0\nProjected QI Hours: 0\nDetails: IMPORTANT NOTE:  We only render  4 hours per week  for this task.\nThe goal will be to spend time reducing the errors mentioned in your theme check so that our code follows the Shopify liquid guidelines.\nIt‚Äôs important that you learn from it so that you improve the quality of your liquid code over time.\nYou can currently see the results of this in the TestResults file on your local - all those issues need to go (after we‚Äôll do ESlint and Prettier as well)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Adding POS specific shipping methods for drop ship orders from Retail store\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-01-08\nDeployment Date: N/A\nTotal Project Hours: 24\nProjected Dev Hours: 18\nProjected QI Hours: 4\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the following task below:\nBackground: Voluspa occasionally have customers make purchases within their retail store and have the order delivered to a residential address as opposed to taking it home. Currently, their store associates select/charge their Ground Shipping rate that they offer online. The order processes just fine but they experience a couple issues on the NetSuite side. and it would benefit them  to create a shipping method specific to POS. \nTASK:  If the  ‚ÄúPOS Ground‚Äù shipping method has been created, we need to HIDE that option from their online customers at checkout (like what is done for employees purchase) and specifically only show that as an option on POS\n- Client is not using any any shipping method in POS right now.\n- In their shipping settings on Shopify. What the client would plan to do just like the Employee Ground and Emloyee Will Call, they‚Äôll create a new rate (see screenshots) and create", ' the same rate in netsuite. It would be named something like  Free Ground - Store  and client wants that to be the ONLY shipping option to show for the POS or for the associates to select if they\'re creating a Dropship order from POS. The new rate would show up on this list -  https://prnt.sc/2tVVdnTzLpxE  but it should only be visible to the POS and not on their website.\nBut before the client creates this new rate,  he would need it to be  HIDDEN  from the front end so their regular  customers wont see it as an available option to them. \n- Client don\'t think they‚Äôd charge for Drop Shipping from the store. It would be a  FREE SERVICE. \n- We need to have the same logic as they have currently for Employee Ground and Employee Will Call where in when an employee is logged in and along with it is their company code, they only get to see those 2 shipping rates in the front end. So, for  POS it should only show the ‚ÄúFree Ground -Store‚Äù.\n- Provided that its the only shipping rate that should show up for POS, let‚Äôs have it assigned automatically. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - New Task - Metafields Update\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: N/A\nDeployment Date: 2024-03-01\nTotal Project Hours: 11\nProjected Dev Hours: 8\nProjected QI Hours: 2\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the tasks below:\nBackground: In Shopify, client would like to convert the following metafields to be editable in an open text box as opposed to trying to edit within the single-line-text option that they have currently. They would need to scroll through the single-line-text to go in and edit which for them is not efficient.  Please see screenshot:\nTASK:   We need to update the following metafields (screenshot) to open the text in a larger box for the client to edit allowing them to efficiently make edits/updates to these fields.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - ADA P3 (\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-01-16\nDeployment Date: 2023-12-28\nTotal Project Hours: 24\nProjected Dev Hours: 18\nProjected QI Hours: 4\nDetails: The objective of this project is to fix all found issues below during Voluspa‚Äôs ADA Re-Audit.\nhttps://hub.accessible360.com/projects/6565/issues?p3=true&show_only=in_progress\n- COMPONENT:\nComplete your scentscape/You may also like (Carousel)\xa0 includes description\n- ELEMENTS\nCarousel container\n- FIX\nRemove the\xa0 tabindex="0" \xa0attribute from each element so that they do not receive tab focus.\n- COMPONENT:\nPDP Zoom (Modal Dialog)\xa0 includes description\n- ELEMENTS\nSlide navigation dots\n- RELATED ARTICLES\nList Not Marked Up as a List\n- FIX\nUse standard HTML to mark this up as a list.\n- COMPONENT:\nPDP Zoom (Modal Dialog)\xa0 includes description\n- ELEMENTS\nCarousel\n- RELATED ARTICLES\nCarousels and Sliders \xa0 \xa0Screen Reader Only Text\nFIX\nAdd screen-reader-only text as the first child element of this carousel that succinctly and accurately describes the available functionality.

The idea is for there to be four (4) that we're presetting (automated products/recommendation) in a way so that when the customer lands on the initial page, they see the presets that are selected for them. But it's very clear that they can REMOVE them at that step as well in case they wanted to make modifications to that preset assortment and the ones that are gonna be part of the options are any Classics in a nine ounce format. So it's gonna be anything from the Japonica collection, that Mason collection and the Mermaid collection. We do have a few SKUs in the classic candle collection that WOULDN‚ÄôT be eligible. And that's because of their fill size being 6.5 ounces. So that includes the Holiday collection and the Roses collection. Client‚Äôs main goal there with the Box candles is preventing the ones that are just a lower and ounce fill. So really focusing on the nine ounce classic candle size so I have recommended for them to build a new collection that only includes the build a box use/eligible products. Here‚Äôs the new collection:  https://www.voluspa.com/collections/classic-candle-subscription  \nThere will be it 10% discount that would be included when customers purchase those four items. So that would be something to be taken into consideration. This purchase is going to be a subscription that  would be reoccurring in a quarterly format. So every three months there would be a new offering that client would put forward which they would automatically pick the four that are going to be relevant for that season. \nSKIO have integrated the core functionality and seamlessly integrate SKIO‚Äôs BAB Logic into Voluspa‚Äôs current solution. Upon our assessment, there are a couple of bugs we need to address especially with the design and aligning everything with our current set up. \nTASK 1:  We need to make sure that the subscription logic /SKIO subscription program has been integrated correctly to Voluspa‚Äôs store. \nHere are the links shared by SKIO to better understand the integration:\nTASK 2:  We need to fix all the bugs we could find and make sure that the layout/design for the Winter box matches the current BYO‚Äôs we have. Here are the list below:\n- The height of the winter box is not aligned with the 6TINY and 3MINI\n- Product images are not showing. You would need to hover first before you see them. Make sure that images are displayed correctly just like the current BYO products.\nCheck this video:  https://vimeo.com/896364544/3a440bef2f?share=copy\n- image sizes should match \n- make sure how its mapped on the cart drawer/cart page and checkout matches our current BYOs\nWINTER BOX (SUBSCRIPTION)\n3 MINI TIN\nUPDATE 12/21:\n- Client confirmed that Winter box items can be separated in the cart drawer, cart and checkout page but a ‚Äúline‚Äù calling out that the items are part of the subscription should be included so that if users remove a product that‚Äôs part of the subscription then the ‚Äú10% discount‚Äù and ‚Äúcallout line‚Äù would also be removed making the purchase as a stand alone. \n- The callout would be ‚ÄúSubscription Bundle‚Äù which will be placed on each respective spots:\nCart Drawer:\nCart Page:\nCheckout Page:\n- Make sure the image showing after reviewing the products are matching the current design/set up\nWINTER BOX\n3 MINI TIN\nTASK 3:  Since pricing is different across a variety of SKUs, client said that the items being broken out works best! Client would like to ADD also the list of PRICE of the items somewhere, maybe in the selection grid to show the non-discounted price. I just took screenshots of the current BYO as an example.\nThe subscription program will be a little different by comparison to current BYO in a few ways: \n1. It will NOT come in a specific gift box package like the mini tin trio \n2. It will start out with a pre-set group of products.\nWith these two factors, the  SIDE VIEW  will NOT be necessary and could instead be represented by the TOP VIEW image  stacked in a 2x2 representation of the selections, like the screenshot below:\n- The  DEFAULT image    https://prnt.sc/KFJVI7tdFoGZ  could be a representation of the pre-sets again in the 2x2 stack, and  we need to make sure that the images would update dynamically based on the pre-sets associated to the metafield driving the subscription.\n- The client thinks that the  HOVER image  could either be the same image  https://prnt.sc/fZpkO91nVgMC , or they could request a lifestyle image from their content team. If they go the lifestyle route the image would have to be changed seasonally/every 3 months.\n- The  COVER imag", 'e  should also just be a DYNAMIC representation as the customer may make substitutions to their selections and the client wants a dynamic visual that accurately reflects their selections before they add items to the cart.\nUPDATE 12/29 (From SKIO)\nGot a response from SKIO and they have shared these docs that should point us in the right direction with all the issues we are encountering at the moment  @Jay Varmora   @Muhammad Moosa Raza   @Anonymous  \n1.  static setup guide \n2.  dynamic setup guide \n3. dynamic build-a-box:\xa0 dev outline\nHere‚Äôs the screenshot of questions we have asked them: \nUPDATE 1/4\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - ADA P2 (\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:22:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-01-02\nDeployment Date: 2023-12-27\nTotal Project Hours: 32\nProjected Dev Hours: 24\nProjected QI Hours: 5\nDetails: The objective of this project is to fix all found issues below during Voluspa‚Äôs ADA Re-Audit.\nELEMENTS\n"Reviews" button\n- RELATED ARTICLES\nExpandable Content is not Indicated to Screen Reader Users \xa0 \xa0Navigation Menus\n- FIX\nAdd an\xa0 aria-controls \xa0attribute to each element that controls expandable content and set the value of that attribute to equal the\xa0 id \xa0of the tag that wraps the expanded content.

Their marketing team mistakenly activated this prior the go date and so the client was able to see how the promo code is going to be displayed on the cart drawer and he did not like how its showing in the front end. \nScreenshot: \nTASKS: \n- Create a test store to work on this project since we could not work on it directly on the main store because the promo code is not activated. \n- Check how the promo code is impacting the collections page, product page, cart page etc. \n- Implement an enhancement on the default layout/display of the ‚ÄúBlack Friday 2023‚Äù promo they have. We need to change some CSS and position the texts better to make it look good since right now its too crowded. \n- Test our implementation and make sure nothing gets broken with our integration and promo functionality is working perfectly fine \nNote: I have already created a CRO card for this project and assigned it to our designer. I will update here once I get a mock up we could follow. \nHere‚Äôs the figma file:  https://www.figma.com/file/s2LpvzkfeCJj24meigQiJS/Voluspa?type=design&node-id=83%3A4&mode=design&t=XN0zYN7PgxHWClfS-1\n11/23 UPDATE : Client just wanted to retain the default display but hide the ‚ÄúBlack Friday 2023‚Äù text on mini cart. We have added a CSS script (prior to client activating the promo code)  to hide it form the front end. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - New Collection Interrupters  (Collection Level)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:23:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2024-01-24\nDeployment Date: 2024-01-25\nTotal Project Hours: 25\nProjected Dev Hours: 19\nProjected QI Hours: 4\nDetails: The objective of this project is to fix/complete the task below:\nTASK 1:  On the new collection template, putting Interrupters to slots 1, 2 and 22 beyond is not working/displaying. We need to make sure that client has the ability/option to put the interrupters to any of the slots there is in the new collection template\nHere‚Äôs a link where they are using the new collection template:  https://www.voluspa.com/collections/birthdays-anniversa', 'ries-everything-in-between\nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/887679563/e199195227?share=copy\nTASK 2:  Currently, the interrupters are integrated globally.

We need to fix this major issue. \nHere‚Äôs a video taken from my iphone device replicating the issue:  If you are also going to do inspect, this issue is also visible. \nTASK 2:  ‚ÄúNaN‚Äù pricing appearing on PC/Chrome.  We need to investigate why this is happening on some cases. Exhaust our resources to check this and make sure this is not happening. \nBackground: When client was loading them and testing the page, their merchandiser ran into this NaN issue while they were screen-sharing. Client had her copy/paste the URL of this collection into an incognito window and she ran into it again. \nTASK 3:  We need to work on making triggering the Drawer (Storage Preferences) using a Text Link in the Footer. The drawer should  open up which would allow the user to edit their cookie preferences. Please see example site for the expected behavior:  https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/ .

So the banner will be displaying in permissive mode kind of saying by staying on the site you‚Äôre accepting, agreeing to cookies and all that kind of stuff. That banner also gives the user a link to edit the preferences further and so the styling of all that is fine out of the box for launch. \nTASK 1:   So client created a new page  named it ‚Äú Osano Cookie Policy & Preferences ‚Äú. Here‚Äôs the link to the new Osano page  https://www.voluspa.com/pages/osano-cookie-policy-preferences .  We need to build out the footer link page and add/ insert the HTML.  We need to do this for both US and EU stores replacing the current ‚ÄúOne Trust‚Äù. (Focusing on US then EU) \nTASK 2:   Once the bar is launched, we need to make a CSS changes. So, once the banner is launched, there is a little cookie icon that stays on the user‚Äôs screen which will give the user a shortcut to edit their preferences. Client does not want that cookie to be displayed and taking much o any real estate on the user‚Äôs screen. We need to HIDE that from displaying on mobile and desktop. \nHere‚Äôs a link to check the script needed to hid the widget:  https://docs.osano.com/hiding-the-cookie-widget\nTASK 3:  We need to work on making triggering the Drawer (Storage Preferences) using a Text Link in the Footer.

During your testing, make sure that all integrated features found in ‚Äú  Voluspa - Gift Wrapping Project ‚Äù are present plus these new updates below. \n- If the product quantity is updated by the user from (e.i 4) and updated it to 1 the error message should no longer appear and the GW qty should automatically be set to 1. Video:  https://vimeo.com/886476544/1f79e01b43?share=copy\n- Make sure that the GW qty pop up fires/ shows instantly when the product qty is updated to more than 1. Currently it does not pop instantly instead client needs to manually click the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù link to update the GW qty. \nIMPORTANT NOTE :  This feature  will not work for BYO products  since when product qty is updated the page reloads and it uses that as an opportunity to update child items so the auto pop for GW qty wont work for bundles. \nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/886479191/37a74564e3?share=copy\nClient would like to have an option in the customizer that would them to choose (switch) whether they want Gift Notes tied with Gift wrapping or keep it separate and available all the time. \nTASK:  Add a setting in the customizer that would allow them to switch between:\n1.  Gift Notes tied up with Gift wrapping option \n2.  Gift notes separated from GW and be available all the time. (Meaning, it should be available regardless if the user avails of a gift wrapping option or have added a non-eligible GW product) \nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/893339961/7d07adb036?share=copy\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - \nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:23:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2023-11-24\nDeployment Date: 2023-11-16\nTotal Project Hours: 19\nProjected Dev Hours: 14\nProjected QI Hours: 3\nDetails: The objective of this project is to confirm and fix the bug instance reported of this (screenshot) displayng on PC/Chrome.\nTASK:  To investigate what‚Äôs causing the issue/ bug  and make sure to fix it.

The client have already have it stated in the verbiage that ‚Äú we require retailers to have a brick and mortar location‚Ä¶ ‚Äù but they have been receiving a lot of inquiries from people who only sell online, so they have identified/decided that they need to combat/address  that.\nSo, if the submitter chooses  the ‚ÄúOnline Only‚Äù option, there is a notification/error that would prompt in the front end stating  ‚ÄúWe require retailers to have a physical brick and mortar location.‚Äù\nDrop down options:\n- Retail Store\n- Retail + Online\n- Online Only\nUPDATE 11/28 \n I have given the client a heads up that since we are using Klaviyo for Task 1 we hit a limitation with applying the task 2 since its not an available feature in Klaviyo. Gave the client a recommendation that instead of the validation/ blocker, we can either remove the ‚ÄúOnline Only‚Äù from the drop down options or we show ‚ÄúOnly Only (Not Eligible) so that prospective retailers know that this is not being offered by Voluspa. Will wait for client‚Äôs decision/ feedback. \nUPDATE 1/12\nClient have provided a couple of other wishlist/requirement they wanted for this project (aside from the ones mentioned above)\nVideo:  https://vimeo.com/902977075/0de8fe8d44?share=copy\n- For  task 3 ( When the same retailer applies multiple times, for the form to be automatically decline/not allow retailer to continue to reapply ), the client is requesting for the ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù field value to be the unique identifier to use.\n\u200c\n- For the dropdown recommendation task (‚ÄùType of Store‚Äù field) , client liked the idea of adding ‚ÄúOnline  Only (Not Elegible) and they will compose a list for us to display within the dropdown.

It is also removing free gifts and samples from the cart, if customer is employee.\n- Address validation (using checkout blocks app)  reject PO Boxes and show error message\n- Shipping address ruby script (using checkout blocks app 4 hours)  we have ruby script that is manipulating the shipping addresses on different basis and will convert this into Shopify functions.\n- If promo free gift is already in the cart we need to remove the discount code.  I was unable to see this functionality in the checkout blocks, we will have to do research on this part.\nNote for Lead Dev:   Let us make sure to come up with a list of customization if there are any trackers that are needing to be moved  similar to this docume', 'nt -  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x62BRlaQJL6YJBT_kA8iM9i2TZ7f1_SMerulJsXrJkk/edit?usp=sharing  \n(  will remove this sample once we have the list specific for Voluspa )\nClient mentioned that they would like to apply some address validations on checkout.\nThey currently have this one live on their current checkout and we have also applied this to the one page checkout.\nTASK: Make sure we can apply any of these address validations on the new checkout depending upon the needs/requirement of the client\nClient would like us to publish the CE project by December 27-28 and along with this would be the Address Validator app they want us to integrate (Address Validator Plus  https://apps.shopify.com/address-validator ). Also, today 12/20 we have started working on  SKIO Subscription (Build a Box)  project. \n\n Given these updates mentioned, we need to:\n- Make sure the Address validator app (Address Validator Plus  https://apps.shopify.com/address-validator ) is compatible and integrated properly in the new checkout\n- Make sure that the new check out branch is updated with this subscription program project. \n- Make sure that the subscription program (build a box) is aligned with our BYO integration or make sure that needed functionalities especially how this product should be mapped in checkout is considered and ironed out. \n- Make sure we test everything and thoroughly go through all features and functionalities we need to consider for the new checkout before we publish it on our target date.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Gift Wrapping Project\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:23:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: N/A\nDeployment Date: 2024-06-05\nTotal Project Hours: 5\nProjected Dev Hours: 3\nProjected QI Hours: 1\nDetails: The objective of this project is to implement the task below on Voluspa store.\nBackground: \nLast week Voluspa went through a gift wrapping project analysis to determine what we wanted to offer their customers for this Holiday and determined impact to costs and labor - both for online and in-store. \nPROJECT: To implement a GIFT WRAPPING option on their cart page.

However, they hadn't utilized this integration to monitor conversions from their influencers/affiliates. Their social team is now launching a campaign and has noticed issues with the tracking functionality. It's imperative that they accurately track both clicks and conversions for each influencer (currently, they have three influencers in this initiative).\nHere is an article for reference: \n- How to Implement Server Postback with Transaction ID | Aspire Elevate Help\n- postback for Affiliates (tracking conversions):\xa0 https://aspireiq.go2cloud.org/aff_lsr?offer_id=18444&amount=AMOUNT&transaction_id=TRANSACTION_ID\n- postback for influencers (tracking clicks):\xa0 https://aspireiq.go2cloud.org/aff_lsr?offer_id=18445&amount=AMOUNT&transaction_id=TRANSACTION_ID\nTASKS: \nNote: Here‚Äôs a link we could use to help us with those tasks listed above  https://intercom.help/aspireiq_elevate/en/articles/7852711-how-to-implement-global-server-postback-with-transaction-id\nCredentials:\nsupport@ecomexperts.io\nEcomExperts2023\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Collection Page Revamp\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:23:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2023-09-13\nDeployment Date: 2023-10-11\nTotal Project Hours: 0\nProjected Dev Hours: 0\nProjected QI Hours: 0\nDetails: The objective of this project is to complete the following tasks enumerated below:\nNOTE:PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE SITE WIDE FONT UPDATES WHEN IMPLEMENTING THESE CHANGES\nTASKS:\n\nMobile + Desktop mockups:   Collection Page  (last 2 pages of the FIGMA file) \n- Enhance the Collection Top Banner by using this mock up design. There‚Äôs a gradient effect in terms of color and there should be enough space below the Collection Title for the collection description. Make sure there‚Äôs an a available option in the customizer to edit font size, color and family. Check this video:  https://vimeo.com/858794358/3eed5a358c\n- Implement a FEATURE SLIDER below the Collection Banner. This slider will consist of  3 content blocks on desktop and 1 for mobile with center-aligned visibility, partly revealing adjacent blocks on each side, and navigation arrows for seamless browsing. Make sure the texts are placed upper right side of the blocks and make sure client has the ability to change text placement via the customizer. When the user hover‚Äôs their mouse to the text, the opacity changes allowing the user to feel that its a clickable text. Once the text is clicked it should route them to the correct page URL. \nDesktop:\nMobile:\n- Implement the MAIN COLLECTION SECTION. On the new Collection page the set up for the Breadcrumb, Sort by and Filter should be the same as the current set up (live site). Products cards should initially be 4 in a row for desktop but client should have the ability to adjust how many product cards to show per row, but for Mobile there should only be 2 product cards.  When you hover on the product image, it should show the secondary image with the Quick view, Quick Add and Wish List functionality. Client should have the ability to change fonts, size , color for the product tittle and collection title via the customizer.\nMobile: \n- Implement Icons with Texts below the Main Collection Section. The client should be able to control and customize this section and icons via the customizer, allowing them to hide or unhide this section.\n- Implement Rich Text below the Icon and Text section \n- Implement 3-5 of these banners. \n- The client should have the ability to put these interrupters in any position within the listing\n- The first sku in the grid should a swipeable image to", ' be able to rotate through all of the alt images.\n- Implement a full-width interrupter element on the mobile version of the website. We need to create a distinct version of the interrupter that spans the entire width and is strategically positioned at the bottom of the grid. If possible, add flexibility by allowing the client to move this interrupter up/down within the grid.\n- Remove the ".00" cent ending from pricing displays and introduce customization options via the customizer, allowing the client to control and edit price texts, including font attributes.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments: No comments available\n\n\n\n\nProject Name: Voluspa - Best Sellers HP Carousel (LIVE SITE BUG)\nCreated Time: 2025-02-04T18:23:00.000Z\nOriginal Due Date: 2023-09-12\nDeployment Date: 2023-08-28\nTotal Project Hours: 0\nProjected Dev Hours: 0\nProjected QI Hours: 0\nDetails: The purpose of this project is to address and rectify the ongoing issue within the Best Sellers Homepage carousel in the live site.

This will make the customizer settings for error color and button width have no effect on those devices (iPhone and iPad) using safari on iOS. \nFor other devices and browsers, the customizer styles will work as intended.\n\n\nComment 2: QI started testing\nProject: Voluspa - Add ‚ÄúCheck Gift Card Balance‚Äù to site\nQI: Godwin Kyle Olan\n4/7/2025, 9:19:00 AM\n\nComment 3: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî QI NOTES ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nGITHUB DETAILS\nGithub Branch: 35.6062/Project-CheckGiftCardBalance\nBranch Link: https://github.com/EcomExperts-io/Voluspa-2.0/tree/35.6051/Project-UKEmptySampleInCart\n\nTHEME INFORMATION\nTheme Name: 35.6062/Project-CheckGiftCardBalance [Sandbox C]\nTheme Id : 143996977342\nTheme Preview: https://voluspa-us-dev.myshopify.com/pages/gift-card-balance?_ab=0&_fd=0&_sc=1&key=4f3d16381dfe880b58dffae934061d559cc588f45904348bf51b679a90bb5e10&view=check-gift-card-balance&preview_theme_id=143996977342\n\nTESTING ENVIRONMENT\nDevices tested:\nDevice 1: Actual Device Windows\nDevice 2: BS Mac Safari\nDevice 3: BS Iphone 14\nDevice 4: BS Samsung Galaxy S23 Chrome\nDevice 5: BS iPad 9th\n===============================================\n\nTASK - NOT DONE\n‚Ä¢ Create a new page in the same style as the Subscribe page.\n‚Ä¢ Remove the existing signup form component.\n‚Ä¢ Embed the Rise.ai "Check Balance" widget using the provided documentation.\n‚Ä¢ Ensure mobile responsiveness and style consistency.\n\nISSUES IDENTIFIED - YES\n \n \n \n \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nS - Update - Voluspa - Add ‚ÄúCheck Gift Card Balance‚Äù to site\nB - Issues found on the dev theme\nA - Card is not yet ready for theme review\nR - Card moved to issues found\n\nComment 4: QI Done testing\nProject: Voluspa - Add ‚ÄúCheck Gift Card Balance‚Äù to site\nQI: Godwin Kyle Olan\n4/7/2025, 10:10:00 AM\nQI Hours: 0:51:0\n\nComment 5: Theme Name: 35.6062/Project-CheckGiftCardBalance [Sandbox L]\nTheme Id : 141078528093\nTheme Preview: https://voluspa.com/pages?_ab=0&_fd=0&_sc=1&preview_theme_id=141078528093&preview_key=ef2e187c955e9ab60579d2012c766268&view=check-gift-card-balance\n\nGithub Branch: 35.6062/Project-CheckGiftCardBalance\nBranch Link: https://github.com/EcomExperts-io/Voluspa-2.0/tree/35.6062/Project-CheckGiftCardBalance\n\nTasks:\n\n- Create a new page in the same style as the Subscribe page.\n- Remove the existing signup form component.\n- Embed the Rise.ai "Check Balance" widget using the provided documentation.\n- Ensure mobile responsiveness and style consistency.\n\nStatus: DONE\nProof (Screen record): https://vimeo.com/1072656057/502a456331\n\nSteps:\n1.

This will make the customizer settings for error color and button width have no effect on those devices (iPhone and iPad) using safari on iOS. \nFor other devices and browsers, the customizer styles will work as intended.\n\n\nComment 6: QI started testing\nProject: Voluspa - Add ‚ÄúCheck Gift Card Balance‚Äù to site\nQI: Godwin Kyle Olan\n4/9/2025, 10:15:00 AM\n\nComment 7: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FINAL QI NOTES ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\nGITHUB DETAILS\nGithub Branch: 35.6062/Project-CheckGiftCardBalance\nBranch Link: https://github.com/EcomExperts-io/Voluspa-2.0/tree/35.6051/Project-UK...

Or should the banner only appear when the threshold is met? Screenshot\n- The UI for the cart page seems to be missing. Are we removing the sample feature from the cart page? Also, there is no button in the cart drawer to visit the cart page‚Äîshould we add one?\n- Should we add an option to set a selection limit? Screenshot Or should there be only one product sample and one free gift? (The reference site allows multiple selections: Screenshot)\n- If a user selects a product Screenshot but closes the cart drawer without clicking the checkout button, should the product still be added? Or should it only be added when they click "Proceed to Checkout"? Also, should that button redirect directly to the checkout page?\n- Just to confirm, should the complimentary section always be displayed at the bottom of all regular products? Screenshot (For example, if a user adds a 4th product, should the complimentary section appear after the first product?)\n- Should we enable the discount code input? Screenshot (Since we removed it from the live site, do we need to add it back?)\n\nTHE QUOTE MIGHT BE CHANGE BASED ON THE ANSWER\nTask: \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nerence between the threshold and the cart total?
